    <h2>About My Interests</h2>

    <p>
      My interests lie at the crossroads of data, business, and innovation. I’ve discovered that data science isn’t just about crunching numbers—it’s about uncovering meaningful insights that can guide smarter decisions. Through my academic journey, I’ve delved into economic models that illuminate how markets behave, and I’ve picked up business analytics skills that help me translate raw information into actionable strategies. When I’m not working on class assignments, I’m exploring the ways technology can be harnessed to solve everyday challenges. One of the highlights of my experience has been contributing to the development of a dating app startup, where I see firsthand how data-driven features can transform how people connect.

      I’m always eager to collaborate with diverse teams and learn from different perspectives, because I believe that the best solutions emerge when curious minds come together. Whether it’s coding a new feature, analyzing a dataset for hidden trends, or brainstorming a fresh product idea, I thrive on the excitement of continuous learning and growth. This page offers a closer look at the areas I’m most passionate about, from emerging tech to market research, and everything in between. It’s a reflection of how I blend analytical thinking with a desire to make a tangible impact on the world around me.
