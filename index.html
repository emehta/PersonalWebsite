      I’m Eshaan, a junior at Northeastern University studying Data Science and Economics with a minor in Business Analytics. I’ve always been fascinated by the way data can reveal patterns and how economics can shape business decisions. When I’m not diving into class projects, I’m exploring new ideas through internships and participating in campus clubs, including entrepreneurial ventures that spark my curiosity. One of my biggest projects right now is working on Chaos, a startup dating app where I get to combine my passion for data-driven insights with real-world problem solving.

      Beyond academics, I love interacting with people from diverse backgrounds, sharing ideas, and tackling challenges together. Whether it’s a quick brainstorming session or a long discussion about market trends, I’m always up for something that stretches my thinking. On this website, you’ll find more about my interests, the projects I’m working on, and the goals that drive me every day. I hope this space helps you understand who I am, what I care about, and how I plan to make an impact in the world of data science, economics, and beyond.
